 ### Project Overview

This data analysis project is aimed at to analyze and visualize material transactions over a 12-month period to understand:

- Resource consumption and spending patterns.

- Departmental and classification-level usage.

- Monthly trends and cost peaks.

- Data-driven insights for inventory, budgeting, and procurement decisions.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "CONSOLIDATED REPORT.xlsx" containing detailed information about each material transaction by all the departments. 

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning [Download Here](https://microsoft.com)
- AI - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating Reports.

### Data Cleaning-Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following task;
  
- Data Loading
- Data Inspection
- handling Missing Value
- Data Cleaning & Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the Consolidated Report to answer key question such as;

- Summary statistics (averages, totals, etc.)

- Trends over time

- Comparisons across categories or regions

- Charts (bar, line, pie, etc.)

### Data Analysis

- Uploading file
- Using the EDA questions

### Result-Finding

The analysis results are summarized as follows 
- Total Transactions:5980
- Total Spending:$2462856.968007087
- Mechanical (MECH) accounts for ~55% of total spend
- Instrumentation (INST) follows at ~24%

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions
- Regularly review supplier performance and pricing for these high-value items to negotiate better terms or identify alternative vendors.
- Use this high-value transaction data to inform budgeting and forecasting for future periods, focusing on departments and equipment with the highest impact.
- Analyze the lifecycle and maintenance records of equipment linked to high-value transactions to identify opportunities for cost savings or preventive maintenance.
- Consider implementing stricter controls or additional review for capital spares and critical equipment purchases, as these drive the largest single expenditures.

### Limitation

I had to remove all blank columns & rearrange the date because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusion from the analysis.
